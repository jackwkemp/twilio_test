# Twilio Testing
An example of a piece of work I completed at my previous employer.

Aim:
To test out a new service provider for sending outbound SMS messages 

Context:
My previous employer wanted to test out a new company for sending out SMS messages to private hire vehicle drivers. Mostly this product was used by our Quality of Service team to message drivers who had a high number of cancellations, warning them that if they continued to cancel rides, then we would temporarily disable their account.

I created a few test environments:

- A Python script that connected directly to the Twilio API
- A Flask application designed to mimic how the product could be integrated into our system
